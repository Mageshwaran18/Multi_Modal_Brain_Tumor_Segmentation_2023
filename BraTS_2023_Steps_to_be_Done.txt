BraTS 2023 Steps to be Done 

* Download the data --> Done 
* Extract the data --> Done
* Setup Environment & GitHub --> Done
* Documentation --> Done
* Iterate through every data and find that each patients have their own 4 modalities and their segmentation ( Both Training & Validation )
* Visualize a sample both 4 files & Segmentation , their pixel values maximum to minimum 
* Data Pre Processing
	* Normalization 
	* Resampling 
	* Check that all images has the 1mm^3 resolution
	* Data Augmentation ( Search for any tecniques )
* Data Set for training :
	* Split training & Validation 
	* Data loader ( Ensuring while training the model gets each MRI sequence and it's corresponding labels )

* Architecture design :
	* Select a Architecture 
	* Consider using a multi-task learning approach to perform both segmentation and classification (if required).

* Implement the model :
	* code for the architecture 
	* Intialize model weights , loss function , Optimizer 

* Train the model :
	* Apply techniques like learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and model checkpointing to ensure optimal performance.

* Evaluate the model :
	* Use relavant metrics 
	* Predict and compare the predicted and truth 

* Fine tune :
	* Adjust hyper parameter or regularisation or transfer learning or data augmentation 

* Validate :
	* Validate the external model using the validation dataset
